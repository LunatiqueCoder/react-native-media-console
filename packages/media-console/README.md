VideoPlayer for the React Native `<Video/>` component at [react-native-video][15].

[![demogif][16]][17]

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

This package contains a simple set of GUI controls that work with the [react-native-video][15] `<Video>` component.
- [x] `react-native-reanimated`
- [x] Back Button
- [x] Volume bar
- [x] Fullscreen button
- [x] Play/Pause button
- [x] Rewind/Forward buttons
- [x] Seekbar
- [x] Title
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Timer
- [ ] Rate button

By default the `<VideoPlayer>` accepts a navigator property from React's built-in `<Navigator>` which pops the current
scene off the stack when tapped. Alternatively you can provide your own onBack prop to the component to override this
functionality. You should also provide your own onEnd prop to the component so it knows what to do when a video ends
playback.

By default, tapping the screen anywhere will show the player controls. After 15s the controls disappear. Double tapping
will toggle fullscreen.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Run `yarn add react-native-video react-native-media-console`

If you are using TypeScript, you will also need to run `yarn add --dev @types/react-native-video`

Then follow installation instructions
from [react-native-video][15].

If you are using `react-native-reanimated`, then you can use `yard add @react-native-media-console/reanimated`

## üõ† Usage

The `<VideoPlayer>` component follows the API of the `<Video>` component
at [react-native-video][15]. It also takes a number of
additional props which are outlined in the [API](#-api) section.

For basic operation the `<VideoPlayer>` component requires a video source and a navigator property. The default back
button functionality in the component relies on using the built-in `<Navigator>` functionality in React Native and pops
the current scene off the stack. This can be overridden if desired, see the [API](#-api) for more details.

```javascript
// At the top where our imports are...
import VideoPlayer from 'react-native-media-console';
// üëá if you use react-native-reanimated 
import {useAnimations} from '@react-native-media-console/reanimated';

// in the component's render() function
<VideoPlayer
    useAnimations={useAnimations}
    source={{uri: 'https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4'}}
    navigator={props.navigator}
/>;
```

To play a local file, use require syntax like so:

```js
<VideoPlayer source={require('path/to/file')}/>
```

## üß∞ API

The `<VideoPlayer>` component can take a number of inputs to customize it as needed. They are outlined below:

### Props

You can pass any of the props that the `<Video />` component at [react-native-video][15] takes. Simply add them onto
the `<VideoPlayer />` and it will pass them through to the `<Video />` component.

In addition, the `<VideoPlayer />` also takes these props:
